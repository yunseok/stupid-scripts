My stupid and personal scripts I use almost everyday. I'm using this repository if I add more scripts...

Everything is added as an env on my machines and most them are already executed and I just have to press some buttons on my keyboard to execute them.  

## Putain2RER

Funny story, my workplace is far from my home so I sleep in the train, this script just wakes me up when I'm about to arrive home or at work. I'll probably add some alert if some cunt is trying to steal from me while I'm asleep.

## WakeUpAlan

I always forget to take my pills when I wake up, so it just play an audio of an explosion that tells me to take my pills when I wake up...

## ScottThots

I fucking hate that episode, I usually play The Office (US) on my fourth screen when I'm doing stuff such as programming so I just made a script to skip this particular episode and Dinner Party. FUCK THOSE EPISODES.

## ImThirsty

Like most humans, I get thirsty, so I when I execute this script, it calls either the coffee machine or the fridge to get me a drink and it's ready when I just arrive. Yeah, I added a Rasberry Pi on my coffee machine and set up a Linux server...

## DadsTV

My dad always asks me for help just to switch the window browser to the TV so he can watch stuff on the TV, I made a script to automate it so I don't have to get up and do it manually. 

I taught him the shortcut to do it but he always forget it for some reason...

## SpyOnYourEx

Script to spy on my ex-girlfriend by downloading her stories and her pictures automatically and anonymously when she submit a new picture or a new story to instagram, it includes metadata from the profile, pictures, etc...

It watches if my ex did something every 30 minutes or 1 hour, this can be changed depending on the user, I personally use every 12 hours. So if you want to use this you'll need to execute the login script first then the elizabeth script while having a machine open... You can use Heroku or any cloud-based thing to execute this script. I personally use my Shadow PC

Elizabeth, if you're reading this, how the fuck did you find this? Also, call me.

## LogRefresher

Just a script that output a text file that keep getting updated frequently in real time, useful for other scripts

## SuckOnThisShadow

Scripts for my own "Shadow PC", It's just a remote desktop with the usage of the NVIDIA Shield. The script is just a shortcut to change some mappings that doesn't work such as the Windows Key or Alt+Tab

## TinderAutoLike

Simple autolike for tinder in JavaScript, it just clicks on the like button and if it finds a match it also clicks on it. Also works for Bumble, just need to edit the class names

## GTAVModRemover

Remove mods from the GTA V folder and move it to a backup folder, I made this to play online safely
